# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The written analysis has the following:
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the impact of the "silver tsunami", the large number of retirements Pewlett-Hackard is going to face. Then, test the viability of a mentorship program to mitigate the harms of the silver tsunami by training existing company personnel into the positions that will soon be vacant. 

## Results: 
- 90,398 will need to be filled. This breaks down into 25,000+ positions in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles each, 10,000+ positions in Staff and Engineering roles each, 4,502 technical leader positions, 1761 assistant engineers positions and 2 manager positions.

- There are 1,941 employees across departments eligible to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, meaning there is a large deficit in the number of employees needed to mentor the next generation, as each employee would have to mentor 47 employees.

- There is especially a lack of Senior Engineers as there are only 302 senior engineers while 25,000+ Senior Engineer positions need to be trained. There are 521 Senior Staff employees who can mentor for the 25,000+ positions that will need to be filled. 

- 

## Summary: 
- There are a large number of employees in senior positions who will be retiring soon.
- There is a deficit of employees capable of training current employees to the necessary level.
- Specifically in senior positions, which will see a high number of retirements, there is a lack of mentorship eligable employees.
